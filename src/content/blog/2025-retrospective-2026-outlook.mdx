# The "Word" of 2025

2025 wasn't just another year; it was a year defined by **Evolution**.

> This year marked a significant shift in my career and personal life. Unlike my [2023](/blog/2023-retrospective) and [2022](/blog/2022-retrospective) reviews, it wasn't about learning a new framework or shipping a side project; it was about maturing. From my role as a Senior Software Engineer to stepping up as a Team Leader at [RedCarbon](https://redcarbon.ai), and realizing a lifelong dream in Japan, 2025 was the year I moved from "doing" to "leading" and from "wishing" to "experiencing".

# Impact Matrix (Highlights & Lowlights)

Instead of a chronological list, here are the moments that mattered, categorized by their impact on my life and career.

## High Impact / High Joy (The Wins)

_These are the moments I want to multiply in 2026._

- **Family Milestone:** Celebrating my girlfriend's graduation was a huge moment for us. Seeing her hard work pay off was one of the happiest days of the year.
- **RedCarbon Series A & Growth:** Finally, the company is really gearing up. Closing our Series A round brought a huge wave of energy. Being part of this growth and transitioning into a Team Leader role at [RedCarbon](https://redcarbon.ai) has been incredibly rewarding. A massive shoutout to the entire team—we achieved this together (and the retreat at **Lake Viverone** was the perfect celebration!).

* **Linkin Park - First Live Concert:** I attended my first-ever live concert at I-Days, and it was legendary. Seeing **Linkin Park** return to the stage years after Chester Bennington's passing was emotional and powerful. The energy was indescribable.

- **Japan - The Dream Trip:** In June, I finally fulfilled my dream of visiting Japan. It was incredible—a perfect mix of history and "nerd" culture. Visiting **Sensoji**, the first temple I saw, remains a core memory, along with collecting _Goshuin_ and exploring the arcades. It wasn't just a vacation; it was an experience that left me wanting more.

- **OS Day 2025:** Organizing this year's edition of [OS Day](https://osday.dev) was a massive amount of work, but the payoff was huge. The feedback from speakers and the audience was overwhelmingly positive. The retreat in **Umbria** with the Schroedinger Hat folks was the perfect way to recharge and connect deeper with the community.

## The "Shift" (High Impact / New Challenge)

_Necessary evils that moved the needle._

- **The Career Dilemma (Technical vs. Management):** This year I faced a big question: Technical Lead or Staff Engineer? I decided to step into the Team Lead role to explore the management side. The driving force isn't title, but impact: I want to support the team's growth and help my Engineering Manager by sharing the strategic load. It’s challenging, but clarifies my path between pure management and technical leadership.

## The "Lesson Learned" Moments

_Failures or deviations that taught me something valuable._

- **Stepping Back from the Stage:** I participated in very few events this year and none as a speaker (shoutout to GO Lab where I attended just to enjoy the community!). I learned that it's okay to pause public speaking to focus on career growth. You can't do everything at 100% all the time.

# The "System" Upgrade (v2026)

How my "Personal OS" evolved this year.

## Tools of the Trade

- **AI-Powered Development (Antigravity & Cursor):** Towards the end of the year, I refreshed this very website using AI tools like Cursor and Google's Antigravity. It was an experiment to see what "low-code/high-ai" could do, and the results are interesting. (Expect a full technical deep dive on this in early 2026!).

## Mindset Shifts

- **Exploration over Definition:** I'm not locking myself into a "Manager" or "IC" box yet. I'm using this TL role to learn skills I didn't have (delegation, project planning) while keeping my technical roots alive.

## Habits That Stuck

- **Ju Jutsu (Hontai Yōshin-ryū):** I took a few trial lessons in December at [Yawara](https://www.camyawaravr.it/wp/) and was instantly hooked. It's my commitment to physical health (weight loss goals!) and mental discipline. I'm enrolling officially in Jan 2026 to start this journey for real!

* **BBQ Mastery:** I’ve leveled up my cooking game significantly this year. From ribs to huge steaks and picanha, the BBQ became my weekend meditation (and the best way to feed friends).

# Nerd Culture & Media Diet

It wouldn't be a retrospective without the "fun" stats. 2025 was a great year for stories.

## Gaming & Tabletop

- **Video Games:** I verified the 100% completion of _Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_ (absolute masterpiece) and I'm currently wandering the lands of _Ghost of Tsushima_.
- **Board Games:** _Pandemic Legacy_ took the crown this year.
- **D&D:** Played two campaigns that I loved. First as **Silas Ramsay** (Elf Rogue), and then as **Thalion Melora** (Half-Elf Bard).

## Watchlist

- **Documentaries:** _My Octopus Teacher_ and _Free Solo_ — both incredibly inspiring for different reasons.

# 2026 Outlook: Architecting the Future

## The North Star

**Consolidation & Content** -> In 2026, I want to solidify my leadership role and share my journey more consistently with the community.

## Areas of Focus

1.  **Career Clarity:** Continue navigating the TL path. By the end of 2026, I want a clearer answer to the "Manager vs. Staff Engineer" question.
2.  **Content Consistency:** I want to be more present socially. More technical blog posts, LinkedIn updates, and newsletters. Sharing what I learn, as I learn it.
3.  **Physical & Mental Discipline:** Consistency in Ju Jutsu. It's not just a sport; it's a lifestyle change I'm ready for.

# The Anti-Goals

To make space for the above, I am explicitly deciding **NOT** to do the following in 2026:

- **Stress-Driven Speaking:** I'd love to return to the stage, but only if it's fun and sustainable. No more speaking just for the sake of it ("nice to have", not "must have").
- **Stagnation:** I refuse to settle. Whether it's pushing for the Series A goals, exploring AI, or earning my first belt, 2026 is about forward motion.
